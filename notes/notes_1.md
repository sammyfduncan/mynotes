Okay, here are well-rounded, informative study notes based on the provided lecture slides:

**Course Overview: SCC.111 Software Development**

*   **Instructors:** Adrian Friday, Nigel Davies, Hansi Hettiarachchi, Saad Ezzini
*   **Core Skill:** Software development is emphasized as a fundamental skill with wide applications.
*   **Course Value:** It's essential for many future career paths, will reduce overall coursework burden in the future, and can be enjoyable.
*   **Course Objective:** More than "just a programming course". It aims to instil a principled approach to programming, focusing on imperative programming, the software development lifecycle, and relevant tools and techniques.
*   **Perspective:** Programming is presented not just as a technical skill but as a creative tool.

**Course Structure & Teaching**

*   **Lectures:** There are two lectures per week (repeated once).
*   **Practicals:** Attending the assigned practical class is mandatory.  Additional practical sessions are available if space allows.
*   **Out-of-Class Work:** Students should anticipate needing to work outside of scheduled lab hours. The Moodle forum should be used to get help.
*   **Timetables:** Timetables for both majors and minors are provided, specifying when practical sessions are scheduled in labs.

**Assessment**

*   **Breakdown:** 70% exam, 30% coursework
*   **Importance:** Coursework helps you pass the exam. The final exam is in the summer term and has high weighting.
*   **Coursework Components:**
    *   Online tests and programming activities (weeks 5, 10, 15, 20).
    *   A more open-ended coding project (weeks 21-25).
*   **Submission:** Coursework is submitted online. Plagiarism checks are conducted.

**Learning Culture & Expectations**

*   **Experience Levels:** The class will have students with varying levels of prior experience.
*   **No Panic:** If you have limited or no experience, that's OK! Don't feel pressured by others.
*   **Advanced Students:** Those with more experience are encouraged to take on advanced exercises and assist their peers.

**Academic Integrity**

*   **Emphasis:** The course is designed for learning, and work submitted must be the student's own.
*   **Prohibited Actions:**  Using AI, getting direct help from friends, family or online is not allowed. You must work on individual assignments alone.
*   **Collaboration:** Discussion and learning from peers are encouraged, but the exchange of code or answers is strictly prohibited.
*   **Plagiarism Detection:**  All submitted code is checked for plagiarism.

**Feedback & Good Learning Practices**

*   **Formative Assessment:** Weekly lab exercises provide detailed feedback.
*   **Note-Taking:** Keeping written notes is recommended for reflection.
*   **Summative Assessment:** Quizzes and a Project will make up the summative assessment for the course.
    *   Quizzes are typically returned with marks within a week.
    *   The project is due week 25, with marks returned within 4 weeks.
*   **Extenuating Circumstances:** Contact the SCC Teaching Office (TO) if you have any issues.

**Instructor Expectations**

*   **Integrity:** Honesty in your work is essential.
*   **Stay Current:** Keep up-to-date with the course materials.
*   **Attend:** Regularly attend lectures and practicals.
*   **Textbook:** Acquire the textbook (available second-hand).
*   **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask questions for clarification.  There are no silly questions.
*   **Timely Work:** Start coursework when it is assigned.

**What is a Program?**

*   **Definition:** A detailed plan or procedure for solving a problem with a computer. More specifically, "an unambiguous, ordered sequence of computational instructions necessary to achieve such a solution".
*   **Algorithms:** A basic example algorithm is provided for counting people in a lecture hall. This involves linear time complexity.
*   **Key Components of Program:** A step in the process, decision, and a program flow.

**Imperative Programming**

*   **Definition:** A programming paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state.
*   **Critical Thinking:** Think about what to represent (data) and how the program should manipulate it.

**The C Language**

*   **Choice:** C is the first language you'll be learning in this course.
*   **History:** Developed in the 1970s for building UNIX.
*   **Characteristics:** It's compact, low-level, and used to generate fast, efficient code, still used a lot in current systems.
*   **The "Tool Chain":** C is a "compiled language," you must use a text editor to write the code, a compiler to translate the code, and then run the executable.
*   **Example:** A basic "Hello, world" program is provided.
*   **Reference:** The book "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie is highly recommended and the definitive reference. Available online in the Library.

These notes provide a structured summary of the key topics covered in the lecture. Good luck with your studies!
